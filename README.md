# raspi-sensors
Sensor reading linux C applications for rasperry pi using wiring pi libs

I have started this project because of my home automation project. I needed some simple C sources to read sensors and save the data periodicaly to /tmp so that it can be used by bash scripts to turn light on&off and to do various other tasks.

Since all you find on the net is examples for other tasks, I have bounded these small applications together with the hope that someone can reuse it. I do not want any financial reimbursment for these, but they should not be used in commercial projects. They are simple pieces of code, so basically anyone could write them with a limited effort.
